# 💰 Expense Tracker - Data Science Project

This project leverages data science techniques to analyze and visualize personal income and expense patterns. By examining factors such as income, family size, age, and location, it provides insights into spending habits and offers predictive models for future expenses.

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Ensuring data quality for accurate analysis.
* **Expense vs. Income Analysis**: Understanding spending behaviors.
* **Data Visualization**: Utilizing Matplotlib & Seaborn for insightful charts.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting future expenses based on historical data.
* **Interactive Dashboards**: Presenting findings through user-friendly interfaces.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset (`Income_expense_data.csv`) includes records of individuals' income and expenses, with columns such as:

* `Income`: Monthly income of the individual.
* `Expenses`: Monthly expenses.
* `Family_Size`: Number of family members.
* `Age`: Age of the individual.
* `Location`: Geographical location.

## 💡 Insights
